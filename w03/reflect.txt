1. Mapping the month integer value to the first three characters of the month name could have been accomplished using if else or switch constructs.  

Example of if/else : 

#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS  

#include <stdio.h>  

  

int main() 

  

{ 

  

    int month = 0; 

    printf("Enter month: "); 

    scanf("%d", &month); 

    if (month == 1) 

        printf("\nJAN"); 

    else if (month == 2) 

       printf("\nFEB"); 

     

    

   return 0; 

  

} 

 

Example of switch : 

#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS  

  

#include <stdio.h>  

  

int main() 

  

{ 

  

    int month = 0; 

    printf("Enter month: "); 

    scanf("%d", &month); 

    switch (month) 

    { 

    case 1: 

        printf("\nJAN"); 

        break; 

    case 2: 

        printf("\nFEB"); 

        break; 

    default: 

        printf("Invalid month"); 

        break; 

    } 

   return 0; 

  

} 
 

2.The three types of iteration constructs are for , while , do-while. I used do-while iteration for validation routines, because in do-while the program will run repeatedly (according to the condition we put there) until the correct input is entered. Furthermore, I used do-while instead of while so that program will show the print statement first and then take the input and will see if it matches the condition or not.  

3.I ran the program at the point where I used any iteration, construct or used a new variable to see if my program is working or not. Moreover, in Visual studio errors are shown at the bottom so if I see any error in that then I debug my code. After debugging, I ran my program many times and input different numbers to check if my program works on those numbers or not.
